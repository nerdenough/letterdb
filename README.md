# LetterDB

## Introduction
This repository contains all the source code for my implementation of the
SWEN303 individual project. Based on the Colenso Project, I have named my
implementation "LetterDB" as the site is primarily about storing, accessing
and contributing to letters.

## Startup
The server can be started by running `npm start`. This will start the server
using `nodemon` with the config specified in `config.coffee`.

*Note that running the servers requires the `nodemon` and `coffee-script`
npm packages to be installed globally.*
